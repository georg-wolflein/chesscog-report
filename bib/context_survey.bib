  abstract = {The strength of chess engines together with the availability of numerous chess games have attracted the attention of chess players, data scientists, and researchers during the last decades. State-of-the-art engines now provide an authoritative judgement that can be used in many applications like cheating detection, intrinsic ratings computation, skill assessment, or the study of human decision-making. A key issue for the research community is to gather a large dataset of chess games together with the judgement of chess engines. Unfortunately the analysis of each move takes lots of times. In this paper, we report our effort to analyse almost 5 millions chess games with a computing grid. During summer 2015, we processed 270 millions unique played positions using the Stockfish engine with a quite high depth (20). We populated a database of 1+ tera-octets of chess evaluations, representing an estimated time of 50 years of computation on a single machine. Our effort is a first step towards the replication of research results, the supply of open data and procedures for exploring new directions, and the investigation of software engineering/scalability issues when computing billions of moves.},

  abstract = {By applying semantic analysis to images of extended passages of text, several volumes of a chess encyclopedia have been read with high accuracy. Although carefully proofread, the books were poorly printed and posed a severe challenge to conventional page-layout analysis and character-recognition methods. An experimental page-reader system performed strictly top-down layout analysis for identification of columns, lines, words, and characters. This proceeded rapidly and reliably thanks to a recently developed skew-estimation technique. Resegmentation of broken, touching, and dirty characters was handled in an efficient and integrated manner by a heuristic search operating on isolated words. By analyzing the syntax of game descriptions and applying the rules of chess, the error rate was reduced by a factor of 30 from what was achievable through shape analysis alone. Several computer vision systems integration issues suggested by this experience are discussed.{$<>$}},

In this paper the ‘Chess-board Extraction by Subtraction and Summation’ (ChESS) feature detector, designed to exclusively respond to chess-board vertices, is presented. The method proposed is robust against noise, poor lighting and poor contrast, requires no prior knowledge of the extent of the chess-board pattern, is computationally very efficient, and provides a strength measure of detected features. Such a detector has significant application both in the key field of camera calibration, as well as in structured light 3D reconstruction. Evidence is presented showing its superior robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in comparison to other commonly used detectors, including Harris \& Stephens and SUSAN, both under simulation and in experimental 3D reconstruction of flat plate and cylindrical objects.},

  abstract = {Chessboard and chess piece recognition is a computer vision problem that has not yet been efficiently solved. However, its solution is crucial for many experienced players who wish to compete against AI bots, but also prefer to make decisions based on the analysis of a physical chessboard. It is also important for organizers of chess tournaments who wish to digitize play for online broadcasting or ordinary players who wish to share their gameplay with friends. Typically, such digitization tasks are performed by humans or with the aid of specialized chessboards and pieces. However, neither solution is easy or convenient. To solve this problem, we propose a novel algorithm for digitizing chessboard configurations. We designed a method that is resistant to lighting conditions and the angle at which images are captured, and works correctly with numerous chessboard styles. The proposed algorithm processes pictures iteratively. During each iteration, it executes three major sub-processes: detecting straight lines, finding lattice points, and positioning the chessboard. Finally, we identify all chess pieces and generate a description of the board utilizing standard notation. For each of these steps, we designed our own algorithm that surpasses existing solutions. We support our algorithms by utilizing machine learning techniques whenever possible. The described method performs extraordinarily well and achieves an accuracy over \$99.5\textbackslash\%\$ for detecting chessboard lattice points (compared to the \$74\textbackslash\%\$ for the best alternative), \$95\textbackslash\%\$ (compared to \$60\textbackslash\%\$ for the best alternative) for positioning the chessboard in an image, and almost \$95\textbackslash\%\$ for chess piece recognition.},

The method presented in this paper improves upon the segmentation-based approaches of previous work in piece recognition by introducing a novel approach using classifiers trained on feature descriptors, which is more robust to the similarities in color seen in real-life chess boards.

  abstract = {Development of autonomic chess-playing robots creates several interesting computer vision problems, including plane calibration and object recognition. Various solutions have been attempted, but most either require a modified chess set or place unreasonable constraints on board conditions and camera angles. A more general solution uses computer vision to automatically determine arbitrary chessboard location and identify chessmen on a standard, unmodified chess set. Although much work has been devoted to probabilistic image recognition in general, this paper presents a novel solution to the specific chessboard location problem that is accurate, less restrictive, and relatively time efficient.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an example of project-based learning (PBL) in an undergraduate course on Image processing. The design of a simple, low-cost computer vision system for implementation on a chess-playing capable robot is discussed. The system is based on a standard CCD camera and a personal computer. This project is a good tool for learning most of the course material that would otherwise be mastered by homework problems and study before an exam. An algorithm which detects chess moves is proposed. It compares two or more frames captured before, during and after a played chess move, and finds differences between them, which are used to define a played chess move. Further image processing is required to eliminate false readings, recognize direction of chess moves, end eliminate image distortion. Many Image processing problems and solutions can be introduced to students, through the proposed algorithm. The results are encouraging - students without any previous knowledge in image processing and advanced topics, such as artificial intelligence (neural networks etc.), may attain a chess move recognition success rate greater than 95\%, in controlled light environments.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a real-time application for detecting the moves of a chess game given a video stream from a camera positioned over the board. A custom implementation based on square identification of flood filled regions is used to detect colored chessboards in arbitrary backgrounds. The detected board is transformed to a normalized image, and occupancy of the chessboard is determined by classifying the pixels within each square of the 8×8 grid to check for a piece of a given color. A move is recognized when the current occupancy grid matches the chessboard that results from one of the possible moves from the previous occupancy grid. These moves and occupancy grids are supplied by a chess engine. A simple motion detection method is used to avoid processing frames in which a player is obscuring any part of the board. It uses hysteretic n-frame thresholding of difference images.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a learning-based method for recognizing chess pieces from depth information. The proposed method is integrated in a recreational robotic system that is designed to play games of chess against humans. The robot has two arms and an Ensenso N35 Stereo 3D camera. Our goal is to provide the robot visual intelligence so that it can identify the chess pieces on the chessboard using the depth information captured by the 3D camera. We build a convolutional neural network to solve this 3D object recognition problem. While training neural networks for 3D object recognition becomes popular these days, collecting enough training data is still a time-consuming task. We demonstrate that it is much more convenient and effective to generate the required training data from 3D CAD models. The neural network trained using the rendered data performs well on real inputs during testing. More specifically, the experimental results show that using the training data rendered from the CAD models under various conditions enhances the recognition accuracy significantly. When further evaluations are done on real data captured by the 3D camera, our method achieves 90.3\% accuracy.},

  abstract = {Recognizing three dimensional chess pieces using computer vision is needed for an augmented reality chess assistant. This paper proposes an efficient 3D pieces recognition approach based on oriented chamfer matching. During a real game, the pieces might be occluded by other pieces and have varying rotation and scales with respect to the camera. Furthermore, different pieces share lots of similar texture features which makes them more difficult to identify. Our approach addresses the above problems and is capable of identifying the pieces with different scales, rotation and viewing angles. After marking the possible chessboard squares that contain pieces, the oriented chamfer scores are calculated for alternative templates and the recognized pieces are indicated on the input image accordingly. Our approach shows high recognition accuracy and efficiency in experiments and the recognition process can be easily generalized to other pattern recognition applications with 3D templates. Our approach outperforms the convolutional neural networks under severe occlusion and low resolution conditions and has comparative processing time while avoids the time consuming training process.},

  abstract = {Chessboards are commonly used to calibrate cameras, and many robust methods have been developed to recognize the unoccupied boards. However, when the chessboard is populated with chess pieces, such as during an actual game, the problem of recognizing the board is much harder. Challenges include occlusion caused by the chess pieces, the presence of outlier lines and low viewing angles of the chessboard. In this paper, we present a novel approach to address the above challenges and recognize the chessboard. The Canny edge detector and Hough transform are used to capture all possible lines in the scene. The k-means clustering and a k-nearest-neighbors inspired algorithm are applied to cluster and reject the outlier lines based on their Euclidean distances to the nearest neighbors in a scaled Hough transform space. Finally, based on prior knowledge of the chessboard structure, a geometric constraint is used to find the correspondences between image lines and the lines on the chessboard through the homography transformation. The proposed algorithm works for a wide range of the operating angles and achieves high accuracy in experiments.},
