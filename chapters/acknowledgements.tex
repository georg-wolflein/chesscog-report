\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr~Ognjen ArandjeloviÄ‡ who accepted the responsibility to supervise this project and offered valuable suggestions and advice guiding it to a successful completion. 
This project would not have been possible without his constant support and willingness to devote time in analysing problems, discussing solutions, and providing feedback. 

I would also like to acknowledge Dr~Stuart Norcross for his swift and competent support in setting up a remote GPU lab client for this project. 
I am very grateful to the University of St Andrews and in particular the School of Computer Science for an exceptional education and a truly memorable time. 
Finally, I wish to thank my parents for providing me with the opportunities and encouragement to pursue higher education.
