\chapter{Implementation}
\Cref{chap:data_synthesis,chap:chess_recognition,chap:adapting} explain the design of the chess recognition system in great detail.
This chapter will highlight and justify the main implementation decisions in a brief manner, as permitted by the scope of this report.
For more implementation-specific details, the interested reader may consult the code directly; many important methods are described using docstrings.

The context survey of implementation tools in \cref{sec:implementation_tools} justifies the use of Python as the main language of implementation.
We adopt the PyTorch framework \cite{pytorch2019} to facilitate \acs{gpu}-accelerated neural network training and inference due to its prevalence in the research community, and execute such tasks on a Ubuntu 20.04.1 lab machine with a 6GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 \gls{gpu}.
For many traditional computer vision methods employed in \cref{sec:board_localisation} such as Canny edge detection and Hough transform, we draw on the popular OpenCV library \cite{opencv2000} which provides efficient implementations of standard computer vision algorithms.

\paragraph{Repositories}
The implementation of this project took place in three main repositories, all of which were made public on GitHub\footnote{The code of each of these repositories is supplied alongside the submission, but can also be accessed at \texttt{https://github.com/georgw777/\{repo\}} where \texttt{\{repo\}} is to be substituted with the repository's name. The author of this report was the sole contributor to these repositories.}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{recap}\footnote{\emph{Recap} is an acronym for REproducible Configurations for Any Project, and is published as a Python package on \acs{pypi} at \url{http://pypi.org/project/recap}.}: a Python package for managing configurations and files associated with machine learning experiments.
    \item \texttt{chesscog}\footnote{The name \texttt{chesscog} is derived from its purpose: `chess recognition'.}: Python implementation of all core components of the chess recognition system: data synthesis (\cref{chap:data_synthesis}), the recogition pipeline including training and evaluation (\cref{chap:chess_recognition}), and the transfer learning approach to adapt to new chess sets (\cref{chap:adapting});
    \item \texttt{chesscog-app}: a proof-of-concept web app to showcase the chess inference engine; and
\end{itemize}

Originally, \texttt{recap} was part of \texttt{chesscog}; however, it was later refactored into its own repository and published on the \gls{pypi} because other people requested to use this configuration system, too.
Separating the codebases of the core implementation (\texttt{chesscog}) and the web app (\texttt{chesscog-app}) ensures a clear separation of concerns and facilitates easier testing of both components in isolation.

\paragraph{Continuous integration and delivery}
All three repositories contain unit tests that are executed on every commit via \gls{ci} pipelines implemented with \emph{GitHub Actions}.
Running automated builds and tests that frequently enables bugs and incompatibilities to be identified quickly.
This is especially useful due to the fact that the chess recognition system was developed in parallel with the web app.
\Cref{fig:cicd} provides an overview of the automated pipelines and their interaction between the repositories.

Whenever a release is published in the \texttt{chesscog} repository, it notifies the \texttt{chesscog-app} repository which opens a \gls{pr} where the version of the \texttt{chesscog} dependency is updated.
As with a commit, this causes an automatic build and execution of the tests.
If the developer is satisfied with the \gls{pr}, it can be merged with one click on the GitHub web interface.

The \texttt{chesscog-app} repository has a \gls{cd} pipeline that on every push to the \texttt{master} branch (provided that it passes the build and tests) will build a self-contained Docker image of the app and push that to the web server, thereby updating the hosted web app.
Furthermore, every release in the \texttt{recap} repository activates a \gls{cd} pipeline that publishes the new version of the package on \gls{pypi}.
Both \gls{cd} pipelines are depicted in \cref{fig:cicd} as well.

The pipelines perform so-called \emph{matrix builds} which means that the build and test stages are executed for all supported Python versions in parallel\footnote{In the case of the web app which uses Node.js in addition to Python, the matrix builds apply to the supported Node.js versions as well.}.
This is especially important for the \texttt{recap} package which is listed on \gls{pypi} as supporting Python version $\geq 3.6$, so the matrix builds target versions 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.


\section{Configuration management (\texttt{recap})}
A core principle underlying the implementation of the chess recognition system is that of reproducibility.
All experimental results and metrics that are claimed in this report should be independently verifiable.
To this end, a Python package was developed that serves the purposes of 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item persisting hyperparameters and other configuration settings of any experiment, algorithm, or system that is configurable; and
    \item providing a convenient interface for accessing these configurations as well as a unified means of specifying and managing paths in the project.
\end{enumerate*}
This package is made available on \gls{pypi} because ensuring reproducibility is a common issue in machine learning research.

The configurations themselves are specified in \gls{yaml} format and a core feature of \texttt{recap} is the ability to inherit from other configuration files to override settings.
A common use for such a configuration file is to specify how to train a \gls{cnn} including the architecture and hyperparameters such as the learning rate, number of epochs, etc.
Within \texttt{chesscog}, configuration files are mainly used to specify the parameters of the corner detection system (including its sub-algorithms such as Canny edge detection and Hough transform) and the training of the two \gls{cnn} classifiers.
Furthermore, \gls{yaml} files were automatically generated in the grid search explained in \cref{sec:determine_optimal_params}.
The functionality of inheriting from parent configurations was useful in \cref{sec:transfer_learning_finetuning} where some hyperparameters (the number of epochs) and settings (the path to the dataset) were altered for training the \glspl{cnn} for the new dataset, but the remaining configuration stayed the same.
Finally, the weights of the exported \gls{cnn} models are supplied alongside the state of the configuration at training time to ensure the same settings (apart from data augmentations) are used for inference.

Another core feature of the configuration system is a custom way of specifying paths.
Instead of using relative or absolute paths\footnote{Both variants are associated with issues: absolute paths may differ between machines, and relative paths break when certain dependencies (such as the dataset) are located somewhere else.} in the configuration files, \texttt{recap} utilises a format similar\footnote{The format of \texttt{recap} paths does not completely follow the requirements of a \gls{uri}, but we will still refer to them as `\texttt{recap} \glspl{uri}'.} to \glspl{uri} (although the use of conventional paths is still possible).
First, the user registers so-called \emph{path handlers} that translate specific \texttt{recap} \glspl{uri} to absolute or relative paths.
Path handlers are registered for a specific \gls{uri} scheme\footnote{The scheme of a \gls{uri} is the part before the colon and double forward slash (\texttt{://}).}, so if we create a path handler for the \texttt{data://} scheme pointing to \texttt{/path/to/dataset}, the \texttt{recap} \gls{uri} \texttt{data://images/train} will be equivalent to \texttt{/path/to/dataset/images/train}.
These \glspl{uri} can be used in the configuration files as well as the code itself; 
\texttt{recap} provides the \texttt{URI} class which is fully compatible with Python's native \texttt{pathlib.Path} interface and lazily translates the \glspl{uri} to paths on the host system.
