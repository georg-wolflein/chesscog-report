\section{Approach}
The implementation of this project took place in three main repositories, all of which were made public on GitHub\footnote{The code of each of these repositories is supplied alongside the submission, but can also be accessed at \texttt{https://github.com/georgw777/\{repo\}} where \texttt{\{repo\}} is to be substituted with the repository's name. The author of this report was the sole contributor to these repositories.}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{chesscog}: Python implementation of all core components of the chess recognition system: data synthesis (\cref{chap:data_synthesis}), the recogition pipeline including training and evaluation (\cref{chap:chess_recognition}), and the transfer learning approach to adapt to new chess sets (\cref{chap:adapting});
    \item \texttt{chesscog-app}: a proof-of-concept web app to showcase the chess inference engine; and
    \item \texttt{recap}\footnote{\emph{Recap} is an acronym for REproducible Configurations for Any Project, and is available as a Python package on \acs{pypi} at \url{http://pypi.org/project/recap}.}: a Python package for managing configurations and files associated with machine learning experiments.
\end{itemize}
Originally, \texttt{recap} was part of \texttt{chesscog}; however, later it was refactored into its own repository and published on the \gls{pypi} because other people requested to use this configuration system, too.
Separating the codebases of the core implementation (\texttt{chesscog}) and the web app (\texttt{chesscog-app}) 


Explain the use of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Repositories
    \item CI/CD pipelines
    \item Testing
\end{itemize}
