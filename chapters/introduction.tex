\chapquote{Improving your weaknesses has the potential for the greatest gains.}{Garry Kasparov}
\chapter{Introduction}

The epigraph above -- remarked by former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov in his most recent book \cite{kasparov2018} -- is a profound observation that applies even outside of chess.
With regard to chess in particular, Kasparov implies that you must identify your mistakes and weaknesses in order to improve as a player, and to do so, you must analyse your own games. 

Amateur chess players can analyse games they played online without much effort because the moves are recorded automatically.
However, to analyse over-the-board games\footnote{Usually, players will invest more effort in over-the-board games, both in terms of time and deep thinking. These games will also involve a greater psychological aspect as a result of being able to observe the opponent's expressions. As such, analysing these games should be even more interesting and fruitful.}, players must tediously enter the position in the computer piece by piece.
A casual over-the-board game between two friends will often reach an interesting position\footnote{For example, one of the players might have a few moves that look promising, but is also considering a line with a piece sacrifice. If he decides to play it safe, he will likely want to analyse the piece sacrifice on the computer after the game.}. 
After the game, the players will want to analyse that position on a computer, so they take a photo of the position. 
On the computer, they need to drag and drop pieces onto a virtual chessboard until the position matches the one they had on the photograph, and then they must double-check that they did not miss any pieces.

The main goal of this project is to develop a system that is able to map a photo of a chess position to a structured format that can be understood by chess engines, such as the widely-used Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) \cite{edwards1994}, in order to automate this laborious task.

\section{Software engineering process}
The development of this project is characterised by a very agile approach due to its primarily research-oriented nature.
Regular supervisor meetings were held where progress was discussed, and tasks were set for the next week.
This ensured that changes could be made quickly depending on the outcomes of different approaches that were tested throughout the project.
However, even though this project was primarily research-based, good software engineering practices were still followed.

% first jupyter notebooks then python code for reproducibility
% then unit tests

Important statistics and results were persisted in data files\footnote{The data files are available in the \texttt{chesscog/results} folder.} so they could be used for analysis and plotting later.
