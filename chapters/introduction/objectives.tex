\section{Objectives}
\todo{explain extent of achieving them}
\subsection{Primary}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform a literature review of available methods for parsing chess positions from photos.
    \item Develop an algorithm for detecting the corners of the chessboard as well as the squares.
    \item Develop an algorithm for recognising the chess pieces.
    \item Develop an algorithm that uses the outputs from (2) and (3) in order to compute a probability distribution over each piece in each square.
    \item Evaluate the performance of the developed algorithms.
\end{enumerate}
    

\subsection{Secondary}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a large labelled dataset of synthesised chessboard images using 3D models.
    \item Implement an algorithm that takes as input the raw probability distribution of each piece in each square and outputs a likely \gls{fen} description.
    \item Implement a simple web API that performs the inference pipeline for an input image, returning the \gls{fen} description. 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Tertiary}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a web app that allows the user to upload an image of the chess board to obtain the \gls{fen} description.
    \item Employ transfer learning to demonstrate how the system can adapt to new chess sets.
\end{enumerate}

Note: final tertiary objective was not an objective in the outstet; was added during the project, as it became clear that employing a transfer learning approach would make the system significantly more useful.
